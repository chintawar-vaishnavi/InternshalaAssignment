To run the HTML code provided, you don't need to install any dependencies. However, there are a few steps you can follow to run the code and see the expected functionality:

Step 1: Copy the entire HTML code you provided and save it in a file with the extension ".html" (e.g., "index.html").

Step 2: Open the HTML file in a web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting an option like "Open with" and choosing a web browser.

Step 3: The web page should open in the browser, displaying the top menu, content section, and a map section. You can interact with the page as described below.

Top Menu: The top menu contains several links, including "Home," "Our Product," "About Us," and "Contact Us." You can click on these links to navigate to different sections of the website.

Login: Clicking on the "Login" link will open a modal window with login options. You can enter a phone number, click the "Login" button (which will trigger the "showAddLocationButton()" function), or use the "Login with Google" or "Login with Facebook" buttons.

Add Location: After logging in (or clicking "Login" without entering any details), an "Add Location" button will appear in the top menu. Clicking this button will open a form in a popup window. You can enter the city, location, latitude, and longitude values and submit the form to add a new row to the table and display a marker on the map.

Data Table: The table displays the information entered in the form. Each row represents a location and includes columns for city, location, latitude, and longitude.

Map: The map section displays a Google Map. After adding locations through the form, markers will be displayed on the map corresponding to the latitude and longitude values entered.
